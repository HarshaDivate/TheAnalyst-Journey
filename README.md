# TheAnalyst-Journey

Hi, I'm Harsha Krishna Divate — a recent BCA graduate from India, currently building my way into the world of Data Analytics and AI/ML, with a dream of studying through the Erasmus Mundus program in Europe.

This repository is a living portfolio — part journal, part project space — where I document my daily efforts, learning progress, and project work that reflect my interest in:

- 📊 Data Analytics & Visualization  
- 🧠 Machine Learning & AI fundamentals  
- 📈 Real-world business problems & dashboards  
- 🌍 Erasmus-focused case studies and applications  
- 📚 Self-paced skill-building after working hours (9–5 at my family shop)



## 🗂️ What You'll Find Here

- Mini Projects: Hands-on work in Python, SQL, Excel, and more  
- Learning Logs: My day-to-day reflections, lessons, and goals  
- Resources: Notes, curated guides, and study plans I’ve followed  
- Erasmus Prep: Portfolio pieces aligned with my applications (e.g., retail dashboards, sentiment analysis)



## 🎯 Why This Repo?

I want this space to reflect not just what I know — but who I’m becoming.  
Whether or not I get selected for Erasmus, I’m committed to learning deeply and building honestly.
