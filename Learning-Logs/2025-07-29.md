# ðŸ“š Day 1 â€“ July 29, 2025

### âœ… What I Did Today:
- Created the `TheAnalyst-Journey` GitHub repo
- Set up folder structure: `Learning-Logs/`, `Mini-Projects/`, `Resources/`, `Erasmus-Prep/`
- Practiced committing files and fixing minor GitHub issues
- Understood the roadmap for my Data Analyst journey
- Planned the next 3 weeks of consistent learning logs

---

### ðŸ’¡ Reflections:
- First day felt messy, but I'm proud I pushed through it
- Learning GitHub hands-on is way better than just watching videos
- Naming conventions and structure matter a lot

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals for Tomorrow:
- Add Day 2 log
- Start first mini project â€“ CSV Cleaner
- Add resource files like `study-plan.md`
