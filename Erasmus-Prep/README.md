# 🌍 Erasmus Prep

Projects, notes, and preparation related to my Erasmus Mundus applications.

This includes:

- Projects aligned with program requirements  
- Personal statement prep work  
- Application timelines & reflections  
- Dataset exploration related to mobility, education, etc.

All part of building a strong, skill-based profile for international opportunities.
